# Text Sentiment Analysis

**Source:** Based on code from the [Hugging Face MCP course UnitÂ 2: Gradio client](https://huggingface.co/learn/mcp-course/unit2/gradio-client).

A simple Gradio web application to analyze the sentiment of text using TextBlob.

## Features

* **Polarity**: Score from -1 (negative) to 1 (positive).
* **Subjectivity**: Score from 0 (objective) to 1 (subjective).
* **Assessment**: Classification as `Positive`, `Neutral`, or `Negative` based on polarity.
* Minimal dependencies and easy to set up.
